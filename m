Please keep UIO_MAXIOV test on kmalloc case only.  If you want to
change that, please do that in a separate patch with its own
justification.

Not really, for example, if you had

	/* explain A in detail */
	a() {};

and if you introduce __a() which does __A and make a its wrapper.

	/* explain __A in detail */
	__a() {};

	/* explain A briefly and refer to __a() for details */
	a() {};

Thanks.
