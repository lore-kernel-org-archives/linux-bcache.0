AFAIK, there are two issues with bitfields - layout changing depending
on arch / compiler and the recent gcc bug (yes, it's agreed to be a
bug) which caused wider RMW cycle leading to corruption of adjacent
memory when the type of the bitfield is less than machine word size.
It's not like the defined macros can escape the former.  In fact, I
think the current code is already wrong - I don't see __le/beNN or
byte swapping going on.  We already __{LITTLE|BIG)_ENDIAN_BITFIELD
macros to deal with these, so I think it would be much better to use
them instead of the macros.

For the latter, well, it's a compiler bug and as long as you stick to
machine-word multiples - which I think already is the case, it
shouldn't be a problem.  There isn't much point in distorting the code
for a compiler bug.  If necessary, apply workaround which can be
removed / conditionalized later.

Yeah, that would be much preferable.  Also, while type checking is a
nice thing, I don't think it's a must.  It's C and all the basic data
structures we use don't have typecheck - container_of() doesn't have
dynamic typechecking which applies to all node based data structures
including list and all the trees, prio_heap doesn't, quicksort
doesn't.  I don't see why fifo should be any different.  Type checking
is nice to have but it isn't a must.  I think it's actually quite
overrated - lack of it seldomly causes actual headache.

I don't think it matters all that much but if you're really concerned
maybe make a variant of memparse with min/max range arguments?

Thanks.
