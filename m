It's a layering thing.  It's dm which is sharing exclusive open.  It
should be dm's responsibility to keep track of who's using what.

While I don't know the code, I can't see why it has to be that way.
If a dm device is holding a device, it'll maintain the link between
old and new tables.  If it's being transferred to another device or
whatnot, it really should release the exclusive open and then
reacquire for the new use.

Yeah, the code isn't horribly complex but it's conceptually pretty
ugly.  If dm can back out of it, it would be awesome.  If that's not
something readily obtainable, ah well, another cruft we have to keep
around, I guess.

Thanks.
