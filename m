They're split and made in-flight together.

Disk will most likely seek to the sector read all of them into buffer
at once and then serve the two consecutive commands back-to-back
without much inter-command delay.

Isn't it more like you shouldn't be sending read requested by user and
read ahead in the same bio?

If exposing segmenting limit upwards is a must (I'm kinda skeptical),
let's have proper hints (or dynamic hinting interface) instead.

Thanks.
