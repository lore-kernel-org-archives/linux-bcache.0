That's an odd and misplaced comment. Was just doing testing today at 5M
IOPS, and even years back we've had cache effects for O_DIRECT in higher
speed setups.

That said, we haven't done cache analysis in a long time. So moving
members around isn't necessarily a huge deal.

Lastly, this isn't a great commit message for other reasons. Anyone can
see that it moves members around. It'd be a lot better to explain _why_
it is reordering the struct.

BTW, I looked over the rest of the patches, and it looks OK to me.
However, you didn't CC me on the full series, so I'm missing bits 3 and
5.
