True of bcache.

No idea why you'd want this. You have to be able to handle a rebooting
with a dirty cache, if you hope to handle unclean shutdown - bcache does
this. And if you're running in writeback mode there's probably going to
be many gigabytes of dirty data in your cache, at least sometimes, and
you aren't going to want to wait for that to flush before you reboot.

If you want to flush dirty data with bcache, you can switch back to
writethrough mode whenever you want.

> 3. Our in-house testing was done for large setups with 500GB+SSDs and proportionately large HDDs, on 24CPU machines with plenty of RAM. It's survived heavy IO loads without any locking or corruption problems.

True of bcache.

> 4. Error handling is exactly what enterprises look for - writethrough/readonly modes work seamlessly regardless of SSD failures. In all the three caching modes, the guarantees of completion in presence of IO errors or shutdowns, in terms of granularity and persistence of data written, is identical to underlying HDDs.

True of bcache.

> 5. It works for all known block devices - Software RAIDs, full block devices with or without partitions, individual partitions, various intelligent block devices.

True of bcache.

Which of the above information was proprietary, and should I not be
resending this to lkml or - who?
