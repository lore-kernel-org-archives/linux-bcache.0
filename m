Oh I see it, I screwed that up when I converted a bunch of stuff to
pr_*() macros and my brain was so used to reading the same stuff I
didn't notice it. I'll have that fixed in a minute.

Ok, that's done - it's in the testing branch

Ah, I remember coming across that before now. Got that fixed too, it's
in both the stable and testing branches.

And dm and md are both calling it from their make_request functions,
which is why bcache wasn't getting it.

Was there still a directory in /sys/fs/bcache?
