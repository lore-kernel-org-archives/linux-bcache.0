Oh, I forgot - the reason I squashed them into one patch is fixing the
bug came for free with the rest of the refactoring, and combining them
touches less code.

To fix the bug first, I'd have to reorder struct bio_pair and then just
delete two lines of code from bio_integrity_split(). But the reordering
is unnecessary with the refactoring.
