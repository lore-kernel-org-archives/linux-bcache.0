Yeah, please put something like the above in the patch description.

Maybe I botched symmetry but anyways I *suspect* it probably would be
better to keep css association across bio_reset() give the current
usages of both mechanisms.  css association indicates the ownership of
the bio which isn't likely to change while recycling the bio.
