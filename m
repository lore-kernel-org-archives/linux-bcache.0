Well - there'll only be any performance impact at all when we're memory
constrained enough that GFP_NOWAIT allocations fail, which for these
size allocations definitely isn't normal.

I did test it with forcing everything to use the rescuer, and I also
benchmarked Vivek's version - in any sane configuration, the impact of
punting everything to workqueue is not very noticable (the AHCI
interrupt handler uses more cpu).

Thanks!
