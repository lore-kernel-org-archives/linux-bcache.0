Hi Joe,

In Documentation/device-mapper/cache.txt, is this text out of date?

     On-disk metadata is committed every time a REQ_SYNC or REQ_FUA
     bio is written.  If no such requests are made then commits will
     occur every second.  This means the cache behaves like a physical
     disk that has a write cache (the same is true of the
     thin-provisioning target).  If power is lost you may lose some
     recent writes.  The metadata should always be consistent in spite
     of any crash.

You say that this is the case for thinp, however.  Does that mean that it's
not possible to get stable writes with dm-thin without using cache-control
commands?  I don't see any documentation to this effect.  If so, are there
any plans to change this behavior (or make it configurable)?

Thanks,
-Michael
