Alright, good point.

Looks like that was 7878cba9f0037f5599004b03a1260b32d9050360 - If I
follow your commit message your primary goal was to back the bip vecs by
a per bio set mempool?

I didn't break that (excepting the issue Vivek noted) - but it is true
that my patch adds another allocation (when nr_vecs > BIP_INLINE_VECS,
anyways).

I don't know how big of a deal you think that extra allocation is. If
you're against it, this patch isn't really necessary for the immutable
bvecs I'm working on - just need it if we want integrity bvecs to be
shared like regular bvecs will be.

Something else I noticed is bio_integrity_add_page() doesn't merge bvecs
when possible, like the regular bio_add_page(). If changing it to merge
bvecs wouldn't break anything, then probably most integrity bvecs would
be under BIP_INLINE_VECS.

Thoughts?
