But if it's a pointer to heap allocated memory, but the bio was embedded
in another struct? I've seen a fair number of instances of that (md, off
the top of my head).

If you're sure that in a normal config the slab allocator is going to
complain right away and not corrupt itself, fine. But I've been bitten
way too hard by bugs that could've been caught right away by a simple
assert and instead I had to spend hours backtracking, and the block
layer is _rife_ with that kind of thing.
