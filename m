Well judging by the header for commit 49731baa41df404c2c3f44555869ab387363af43  
("block: restore multiple bd_link_disk_holder() support") it just looks
like Tejun hates the fact that DM and MD are using this interface.  No
alternative is provided; so the "DON'T USE THIS UNLESS YOU'RE ALREADY
USING IT." rings hollow.

Kent was talking about using MD (and though he isn't opposed to DM he
doesn't care to integrate with DM himself).  Either DM or MD would
implicitly enable bcache to use this interface.  But in the near-term I
cannot see why Kent shouldn't be able to use bd_link_disk_holder too.

Thanks for clearing that up.
