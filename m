Bah, missed that one.

It mostly isn't actual flags that are preserved - the high bits of the
flags are used for indicating what slab the bvec was allocated from, and
that's the main thing that has to be preserved.

So that's why I went with defining the things that are reset instead of
the things that are preserved.

I would prefer if bitfields were used for at least BIO_POOL_IDX, but the
problem is flags is used as an atomic bit vector for BIO_UPTODATE.

But flags isn't treated as an atomic bit vector elsewhere -
bio_flagged() doesn't use test_bit(), and flags are set/cleared with
atomic bit operations in some places but not in others (probably _most_
of them are technically safe, but... ick).
