Below is the patchlist for md and block that might help with a place to 
start.  Are there any other places in the Linux tree where we should watch 
for changes?

I'm wondering if it might be in dm-4.4-changes since this is dm-crypt
related, but it could be ac322de which was quite large.

James or Tim,

Can you try building ac322de?  If that produces the problem, then there 
are only 3 more to try (unless this was actually a problem in 4.3 which 
was fixed in 4.3.y, but hopefully that isn't so). 

ccf21b6 is probably the next to test to rule out neil's big md patch, 
which Linus abreviated in the commit log so it must be quite long.  OTOH, 
if dm-4.4-changes works, then I'm not sure what commit might produce the 
problem because the rest are not obviously relevant to the issue that are 
more recent.
