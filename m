No, then you'll run into high order allocation failures with rings that
don't fit in a single page.

Then let's see that, please.

And can we please stop calling them attributes?  They're inputs and
outputs that change behaviour -- they're interfaces.

And no, just for the record, I don't think generic packed variable size
structs are worth the trouble.

If we're going to do a generic interface extension mechanism then we
should put it in its own well thought out system calls, not staple it on
to the side of aio because it's there.  It's a really crummy base to
work from.
