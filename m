It shouldn't be referencing PAGE_SIZE at all - creating a new macro
(BCH_SB_SIZE, perhaps) is the correct approach.

The code that allocates the buffer for the superblock will have to be fixed
too - right now it's probably using __get_free_page(), it should probably just
be switched to kmalloc().

Oh, there's probably a couple. There's probably some stuff that'll break if
btree_node_size is smaller than PAGE_SIZE, too...

If it turns out to be too much for Zhengyuan, I can probably fix upstream too
(but I don't have any hardware to test with).
