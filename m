I _really_ disagree with this approach.

I get that there's a problem, but the bcache code REALLY IS USING THE
RWSEM AS A LOCK; the answer isn't to open code the lock!

Apologies to Christoph for getting distracted and not responding when
you started to explain what the issues were for RT. I'm not really
convinced they're that insurmountable (one of the issues was debugging,
which the _non_owner() stuff always handled just fine), but I'll take it
on faith that this usage is incompatible with rwsems + the RT
functionality since I haven't actually had time to dig into it.

So assuming that's the case, IMO the sanest thing to do is make a new
type of lock - "rwsem_non_process" or somesuch - and use _that_ in
bcache. Not open coding the lock.

It can even live in the bcache code if we want since there currently
wouldn't be any other users, I don't really care. But open coding it?
Come on... makes me wonder what other code in the kernel is open coding
locks because it couldn't release it in the same process context that
took the lock for whatever reason.

Also, nack this patch because increasing the number of atomic ops to
shared cachelines in our fast path. If it does end up being open coded,
I'll make a more efficient version.
