I would say, the code that submits bio with 500 pages is broken. It
needs to take care of underlying restrictions before submitting bios.
And that's one of the reason for having bio_add_page(), especially for
stackable modules.

Agree. But doing the above doesn't help in improving the situation,
just makes it even less clear.
