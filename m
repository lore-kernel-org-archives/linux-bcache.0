Complexity - yes - but if people didn't observe a genuine benefit, why
did they go to the trouble of writing this and getting it included?

A theoretical argument.  Perhaps it's the right assessment of this
issue.  Perhaps it's not.  Or perhaps it depends on the use-case.

I made a theoretical argument from a different point of view in my last email.

I think a body of *empirical* evidence should provide the justification
for this particular change, and until such evidence is forthcoming we
should keep the status quo.
