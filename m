Heh, I actually didn't mean to send these patches out to lkml just yet
(though now I'm glad I did). There definitely is too much in this patch,
it kinda snowballed.

Ohhhh, yeah it is - ABA. That's easily solved though, we do the head %
nr when we're using the head pointer, and let the stored value use the
full 32 bits.

If libaio is the only thing in userspace looking at the ringbuffer, and
if I'm looking at the latest libaio code this shouldn't break
anything...

Sticking the head and tail pointers on the same cacheline is one of my
main complaints. If you could find that comment I'd be interested in
reading it, though.
