So its __bread doing cached operations and after not (ab)using the page f=
rom
there, the writes will never cause the cached old result to go away until=
 the
device gets closed. So (hopefully) last apptempt. Also drop __bread and u=
se
submit_bio_wait. This seems to work. On x64 and ppc64le with 64k pages.

So the only pain with this is that upstream seems to have re-organized th=
e
submit_bio functions in the upcoming v4.7-rc2 kernel. So it is without re=
work
only applicable to older kernels. I was using a 4.4 one, 4.6 in theory sh=
ould be
ok...

Subject: [PATCH] bcache: read_super: handle architectures with more than =
4k
 page size

There is no guarantee that the superblock which __bread returns in
a buffer_head starts at offset 0 when an architecture has bigger
pages than 4k (the used sector size).

This is the attempt to fix this with the minimum amount of change
by having a buffer allocated with kmalloc that holds the superblock
data as it is on disk.
This buffer can then be passed to bch_map_bio which will set up the
bio_vec correctly.
Also get rid of __bread as this is doing cached IO and the only
reason this did not cause weird effects was the direct use of the
page cache page that was returned by __bread.
