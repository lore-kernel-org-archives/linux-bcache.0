Indeed, can someone test 4.1.y and see if the problem persists with a 2M 
bucket size?  (If someone has already tested 4.1, then appologies as I've 
not yet seen that report.)

If 4.1 works, then I think a bisect is in order.  Such a bisect would at 
least highlight the problem and might indicate a (hopefully trivial) fix.
