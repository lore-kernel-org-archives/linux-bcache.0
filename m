I am curious as to how SSD latency matters so much in the overall transaction times.

We do a lot of performance measurements using SQL database benchmarks. Transaction times vary a lot depending on location of data, complexity of the transaction etc. Typically TPM (transactions per minute) is of primary interest for TPC-C.

That'll be good. I'll check with our testing team whether they can run TPC-C comparisons for these three caching solutions.
