Dave,

In this particular instance, we really don't have any bug reports of
stack overflowing. Just discussing what will happen if we make 
generic_make_request() recursive again.

So first question will be, what's the right stack size? If we make
generic_make_request() recursive, then at some storage stack depth we will
overflow stack anyway (if we have created too deep a stack). Hence
keeping current logic kind of makes sense as in theory we can support
arbitrary depth of storage stack.

Yes, if higher layers are consuming more stack, then it does raise the
question whether to offload work to worker and take performance hit or
increase stack depth. I don't know what's the answer to that question.
I have only tried going through the archive where some people seem to have
pushed for even smaller stack size (4K).

Thanks
Vivek
