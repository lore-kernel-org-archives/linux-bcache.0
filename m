Hmmm... so it's actually just padding?  Padding for what?  I thought
it was there to provide space for ptr[], no?

Double confused by the "no" and the following sentence seemingly
agreeing with what I wrote.  So, bkey->key indexes the backend device
- the slow big disk and the associated PTRs point into the fast SSD
caching device, right?  If so, I think 'key' is fine, that's the only
thing which can be key anyway.  As for PTR_XXX, maybe something which
can signify they're the cache would be nicer but with proper comments
I don't think it's big deal.

Thanks.
