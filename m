I'm sure it could be made to work (and it may well simpler), but it
seems problematic from a performance pov.

With stacked devices you'd then have to switch stacks on _every_ bio.
That could be made fast enough I'm sure, but it wouldn't be free and I
don't know of any existing code in the kernel that implements what we'd
need (though if you know how you'd go about doing that, I'd love to
know! Would be useful for other things).

The real problem is that because we'd need these extra stacks for
handling all bios we couldn't get by with just one per bio_set. We'd
only need one to make forward progress so the rest could be allocated
on demand (i.e. what the workqueue code does) but that sounds like it's
starting to get expensive.
