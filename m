Possibly, but the btrfs code uses bio_clone() and there fs_bio_set may
be correct (will have to look at what it's doing, if it's cloning a bio
that was allocated out of fs_bio_set that would be bad..)

I would also prefer to simply drop bio_clone() so that
bio_clone_bioset() matches bio_alloc_bioset(), but regardless that'll
have to be a different patch (and I don't think I've had to update any
of the bio_clone() callers in this patch series anyways).
