Hi Kent,

So above deadlock possibility arises only if multiple threads are doing
multiple splits from same pool and all the threads get blocked on mempool
and don't return from ->make_request function.

Is there any existing driver in the tree which can cause this deadlock or
it becomes a possibility only when splitting and bcache code shows up?

Thanks
Vivek
