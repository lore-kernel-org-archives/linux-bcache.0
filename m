I understand your concern but still if you leave it behind, job is
half done. You moved rq_bio_info in bio front padding but left the
associated cache and mempool behind. I would say we need to clean
it up and then get ACK from dm/md folks.

I am looking at the code and one thing which is not clear to me is
__bind_mempools() which assumes that md->io_pool is always set. With
your change md->io_pool is set only for BIO based targets and not
request based targets. So that will need some tidying up.

Testing of request based target should be easy. Just enable multipath
for your sata disk.

I think we can leave io_pool behind. Just that it remains null for
request based targets.
