Argh. Why is dm using bi_max_vecs instead of bi_vcnt? I could hack
around this in bcache but I think dm is doing the wrong thing here.

Unless I've missed something in my testing (and bcache's BIO_MAX_PAGES
check isn't quite right, actually) bcache _is_ splitting its bios
whenever bio_segments(bio) > BIO_MAX_PAGES, it's only bi_max_vecs that's
potentially > BIO_MAX_PAGES.
