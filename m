I think its more of a different paradigm than complicated. The big
question I'd have to ask is how does it fit with hard real time. That is
a big issue given the gradual merging and getting of "hard" real time
into the kernel proper.

In some ways it's not that strange either. A look at what happens on some
of our kref handling in drivers is very similar but hardcoded.

Is the handling of priority inversion within closures a well understood
and solved problem ?
