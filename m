There was more than one - it was a regular enough to be considered a

Sure, but recursion issue is isolated to the block layer.

If we can still submit IO directly through the block layer without
pushing it off to a work queue, then the overall stack usage problem
still exists. But if the block layer always pushes the IO off into
another workqueue to avoid stack overflows, then the context
switches are going to cause significant performance regressions for
high IOPS workloads.  I don't really like either situation.

So while you are discussing stack issues, think a little about the
bigger picture outside of the immediate issue at hand - a better
solution for everyone might pop up....

Cheers,

Dave.
