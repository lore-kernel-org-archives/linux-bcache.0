Ooh, BTW, the preferred multiline comment format is fully winged one -

How useful is this?  Any chance we can use something simpler (or
understandable at least)?

Let's drop it for now.  -O3 is different from -O2 but not necessarily
better.

Ah, okay, if (b->c->sort == b->sets[0].data) updates b->c->sort to
match the swap.  Wouldn't it be easier to read if it did something
like following?

	bool using_backup;	// or whatever better name you can think of

	out = alloc;
	if (!out) {
		lock;
		....
		using_backup = true;
	}

	Do whatever;

	if (using_backup) {
		/* explain that @out may have changed */
		b->c->sort = out;
		unlock;
	} else {
		free;
	}

It would also be nicer to not do operations which may fail during var
decl.

How much benefit are we gaining by doing this float thing?  Any chance
we can do something simpler?  As long as it's properly encapsulated,
it shouldn't be too bad but I keep having the suspicion that a lot of
complexity is added for unnecessary level of optimization.

In general, functions are preferable unless there are specific reasons
to use macros like mucking with types.

Yes, please do so.  Just match them to the actual function definition.

Thanks.
