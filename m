If it is measurable I'll take another stab at using memory from
__get_free_pages() for the ringbuffer. That really would be the ideal
solution.

The other reason I wanted to do this was for the aio attributes stuff -
for return values, I think the only sane way is for the return values to
go in the ringbuffer, which means records are no longer fixed size so
dealing with pages is even more of a pain.
