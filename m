Are workqueues not getting involved already in your solution of punting
to rescuer thread. In the proposal above also, workers get involved
only if stack depth is too deep. So for normal stack usage performance
should not be impacted.

Performance aside, punting submission to per device worker in case of deep
stack usage sounds cleaner solution to me.
