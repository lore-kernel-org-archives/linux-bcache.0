Ok, you are introducing bio_vec pointer in this patch. May be we can
do it earlier so that we take care of bio pair related issue.

If you are taking mempool as input, then bvec_alloc_bs() name does not
make sense, as I think the very fact "bs" in the name their suggests
that you are taking a pointer to bio set (and not mempool).

Given the fact that bio_vec pool for integrity inside bio set, why not
take additional boolean/enum argument to function bvec_alloc_bs() and
that argument can tell whehter to allocate bvec from which bvec pool.

Can you explain a bit more about immutable bio vecs. I know there was
some discussion and I missed it. So either point me to right mail thread
or just explain a bit more what are immutable bio vecs, how we are
planning to use these.

Is it about during split we don't want to copy bio vecs and that's why we
need a pointer so that newly created bio/bip can point to parent's bio_vec?

Thanks
Vivek
