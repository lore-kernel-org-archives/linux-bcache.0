It's because for the bvec iterator stuff and immutable bvecs, direct
bi_idx usage tends to be either wrong or unnecessary - I had to audit
all the uses in the kernel.

Reason for doing it now is a later patch moves bi_idx (also bi_sector
and bi_size) into a different struct - so doing these cleanup patches
first means a bit less code churn.
