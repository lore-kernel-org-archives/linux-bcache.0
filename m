Another prep work thing - in current code, it isn't really wrong
(slightly inconsistent though).

But the idea is that anything that doesn't own the bio shouldn't assume
anything about bi_idx; the bounce code should loop over the bio starting
from wherever it was when the bio got to the bounce code, not the start
of the bio.

A later patch makes this clearer - __bio_for_each_segment() gets removed
in favor of bio_for_each_segment_all(), and it documents that
bio_for_each_segment_all() is only for code that owns the bio.
