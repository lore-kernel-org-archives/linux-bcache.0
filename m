Mike, this current patch is a pure bugfix, and you can't fault Eric for not
wanting to do work on dm-cache too when all he's trying to do is solve a
particular real world problem. He should be able to do that without having to
dive into dm-cache code too.

Furthermore, pretty much every filesystem has private ioctls and interfaces -
this is no different.

If you dm guys want to standardize something, that's awesome - and in hindsight,
it wouldn't have been a bad idea to CC you guys on the original patches. But
please keep in mind Eric's not a full time kernel developer, and don't crap on
his work just becausue he's not working on dm-cache too.
