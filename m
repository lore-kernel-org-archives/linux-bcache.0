To support arbitrary page size for superblock,include 4K/8K/64K currently,
the off_set of SB_SECTOR should be a LCM(least common multiple) and that is
64. I redefine macro SB_SECTOR and BDEV_DATA_START_DEFAULT just as bellow

The second arg of *__bread(bdev, 16, SB_SIZE)  *has unit of block size and
it need be relocated too.
To suitable this change, bcache-tools need be fixed up too.
As for btree_node_size issues about page size, expecting somebody to commit
a patch.

Kent, maybe you could use qemu to simulate ARM64 arch and there is always
ubuntu image for ARM64 on the internet.
