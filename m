As much as I dislike Oracle that is one of my primary applications.  I
am attempting to get one of my customers to setup an Oracle instance
that is modular in that I can move the storage around to fit a
particular hardware setup and have a consistent benchmark that they use
in the real world to gauge performance.  One of them is a debit card
transaction clearing entity on multi-TB databases so latency REALLY
matters there.  Hopefully I'll have a couple of them setup within a
week.  At that point I may need help in getting the proper kernel trees
and patch sets munged into a working kernel.  That seems to be the spot
where I fall over most of the time.

Unfortunately I probably could not share this specific setup but it is
likely that I can derive a version from it that can be opened.
