Are there currently any plans to add some kind of write-back caching of new blocks (writes) to dm-cache ? 

Earlier I did some benchmarks with dm-cache aswell, and it didn't perform well with write-back caching of new blocks,
while for example enhanceIO performed nicely.. (and yes I understand currently dm-cache isn't even supposed to help much with this use case).
