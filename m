Can you explain what you mean by that in a little more detail?

As an enterprise level user I see both as important overall.  However,
the biggest driving factor in wanting a cache device in front of any
sort of target in my use cases is to hide latency as the number of
threads reading and writing to the backing device go up.  So for me the
cache is basically a tier stage where your ability to keep dirty blocks
on it is determined by the specific use case.
