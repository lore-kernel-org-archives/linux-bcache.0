I was just trying to make the bugfix patch small, since people
complained about too much stuff being done in one patch.

Eww, boolean arguments are always bad. 

You are right about bvec_alloc_bs() being misnamed now... honestly it
doesn't bother me, but it should probably just be renamed to
bvec_alloc().

Much prefer the mempool arg to a boolean, though.

That's my writeup - Tejun and I have been talking about this for ages,
and then Martin Petersen independently brought it up recently and that
was when I decided to just dive in and do it - but they'd probably have
their own ideas about what it's good for. (Tejun wants to reduce the
number of different scatter/gather list implementations).

That's one reason. It enables efficient arbitrary bio splitting, which
enables a whole host of cleanups and simplifications (I've deleted ~1500
lines of code in my tree).

Also, the fact that bv_len and bv_offset are modified is a pain; the
owner of the bio can't use them after the bio has completed, if it
needed to know what memory the bio pointed to it's got to store that
somewhere else. This fixes that.

It's a real pain for error handling in stacking block drivers - if they
want to be able to retry the bio, they have to clone not just the bio
itself but the entire bvec.
