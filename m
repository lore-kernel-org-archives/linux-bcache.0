The correct solution is to rip out the __bread() and just read the superblock by
issuing a bio, the same way all the other IO in bcache is done.

This is the way it's done in the bcache-dev branch - unfortunately, the patch
that does that in bcache-dev is big and invasive and probably not worth the
hassle to backport:

https://evilpiepirate.org/git/linux-bcache.git/commit/?h=bcache-dev&id=303eb67bffad57b4d9e71523e7df04bf258e66d1

Probably best to just do something small and localized.
