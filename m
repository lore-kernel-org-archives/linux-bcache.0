I'm just seeing extra newlines (empty lines), e.g.:
bcache: run_cache_set() invalidating existing data

bcache: bch_cached_dev_attach() Caching dm-4 as bcache1 on set 5c0ba0d0-df36-4684-acc5-45f5b4683788

bcache: register_cache() registered cache device dm-3

EXT4-fs (bcache1): mounted filesystem with ordered data mode. Opts: discard

I think you'll get the stats for via genhd (add_disk) -- the stats are
the 'disk_stats dkstats' member of the genhd's hd_struct.  But as of
now you'll notice that /sys/block/bcacheX/stat only ever contains 0s.

part_stat_inc, part_stat_add are the low-level methods for driving the
counters up.  But I'm not sure why bcache isn't getting these stats  --
disk stats are something we get for free with DM devices so I haven't
really had to dig into these mechanics in detail.

The /dev/bcacheX device was mounted.  I issued 1 to
/sys/block/#{bcache_name}/bcache/stop before unmounting.  I then
unmounted /dev/bcacheX, the remaining bcache device infrastructure was
torn down.  But after that the device that was the cache device was
still held open -- seems like a reference leaked.
