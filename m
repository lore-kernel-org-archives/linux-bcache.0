May be I am missing something, hence I will ask.  Is punting to workqueue
will really solve the issue raised by Neil. 

Due to spliting required, we will be holding some bios in the stack and
these bios can't be submitted till further allocation from pool happens. So
will it matter whether we are waiting for allocation in submitting process
context or in worker thread context.

IOW, say you have a pool of 2 bios. We allocate 1 bio (say bio A),  and submit
it for IO (now 1 bio left in pool). Now, bio A needs to be split up, so we
allocate bio B and submit it (pool is empty now). Now we try to submit bio
B and this also needs to be split. There are no more free bios so we will
wait for some to get free but none of the bios (A and B) have actually
been submitted for IO so nothing will get freed and we have a deadlock
(This is assuming that memory is tight enough that we are not able to do
any allocations from the slab backing the mempool).

biodoc.txt says following.

**************************************************************************
The caller of bio_alloc is expected to taken certain steps to avoid
deadlocks, e.g. avoid trying to allocate more memory from the pool while
already holding memory obtained from the pool.
[TBD: This is a potential issue, though a rare possibility
 in the bounce bio allocation that happens in the current code, since
 it ends up allocating a second bio from the same pool while
 holding the original bio ]
