Tejun,

This is changing the semantics of the clone. Sorry, I missed this
thread and replied separately. But anyway, replying it again here:

You are changing the meaning of __bio_clone() here. In old code, the
number of io_vecs, bi_idx, bi_vcnt are preserved. But in this modified
code, you are mapping bio_src's bi_iovec[bi_idx] to bio_dests
bi_iovec[0] and also restricting the number of allocated io_vecs of
the clone. It may be useful for cases were we would like a identical
copy of the original bio (may not be in current code base, but this
implementation is definitely not what one would expect from the name
"clone").

May be, call this new implementation some thing else (and use it for bcache)?

---

Like Mikulas pointed out, this is an exported function and silently
changing the semantics will break external modules.

Muthu
