Agree 110% - making bio_vecs immutable and keeping the offset in the bio
is something I've been talking about for ages, I'd love to see it
happen.

But that's going to be a much more invasive change so if I'm going to do
it (and I am willing to work on it) it's just going to be a bit. This is
really a stopgap solution.

As far as the integrity splitting, it's similar to what the existing dm
code does (main difference is dm already has the bio cloned, my
bio_split() doesn't assume anything about the bio being split). Not sure
how that affects ownership of the integrity data, honestly that part
kind of confuses me.
