Kent's proposed solution doesn't do that.  The rescuer work item is
used iff mempool allocation fails w/o GFP_WAIT.  IOW, we're already
under severe memory pressure and stalls are expected all around the
kernel (somehow this sounds festive...)  It doesn't alter the
breadth-first walk of bio decomposition and shouldn't degrade
performance in any noticeable way.

It's probably because I haven't been bitten much from stack overflow
but I'd like to keep thinking that stack overflows are extremely
unusual and the ones causing them are the bad ones.  Thank you very
much. :p
