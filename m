You're likely referring to how DM can load an inactive table while a
table is already active.  These active and inactive DM tables can have
the same block devices associated with them.  Loading a table causes the
devices to be opened exclusively with blkdev_get_by_dev.  See
open_dev and close_dev in drivers/md/dm-table.c

I'll have a closer look.

Sure, but I don't pretend to know when bcache will make use of either.
