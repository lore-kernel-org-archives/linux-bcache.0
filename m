Only in this test case; on my real setup, the cache device is also layered on top
Of LUKS.  (On both backing & cache, it's LUKS --> LVM2 --> bcache.  This gives me
flexibility to adjust volumes without messing with the encryption, or having more
encryption devices than really needed.  At any rate, I expect this setup to at
least work...)

Trying these is still on my TODO list (thus the belated reply here) but based
on the responses from Tim Small I'm doubtful this will fix anything, as it
sounds like he has the same problem (symptoms sound exactly the same) and he
says the patches didn't help.

Like Tim, I also chose a large bucket size because the manual page told me to.
Based on the high-level description of bcache and my knowledge of how flash
works, it certainly sounds necessary.

Perhaps the union of people who read manpages and people who use LUKS like
this is very small. :)
