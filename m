I don't think there's any performance implication.  It's just nice to
explain how the complexity went away.  If for nothing else, to point
out how silly the original code was. :)

ide along with many legacy drivers do it.  Any SCSI driver including
libata only does full completion.  I don't know.  Even just trying to
call the function and comparing before & after with the original code
would be good.  I'd like to see at least some form of verification
because the manifested bugs could be extremely nasty and difficult to
track down.

Thanks.
