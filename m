Heh, I won't argue.

The AIO ringbuffer stuff just annoys me more than most (it wasn't until
the other day that I realized it was actually exported to userspace...
what led to figuring that out was noticing aio_context_t was a ulong,
and got truncated to 32 bits with a 32 bit program running on a 64 bit
kernel. I'd been horribly misled by the code comments and the lack of
documentation.)

Alright. Maybe I'll start hacking on that...

Hmm yeah, setup and teardown is a good point.

I never liked aio_context_t too much - in some respects it would be
cleaner if it was just implicit and per thread. But we probably can't do
that since there are legitimate use cases for one thread submitting and
iocb and another thread reaping the events.

But if we do have an explicit handle, I don't see why it shouldn't be a
file descriptor.

But an implicit per thread context might be useful for the use case you
describe... or perhaps we can add a syscall to submit an iocb and wait
for it synchronously, without any aio_context_t involved.

Yes, that's one of the things I want to address with the aio attributes
stuff.

Link? I haven't heard of acall before.
