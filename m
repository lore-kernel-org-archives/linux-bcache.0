Very true, if it's possible. I'm just still skeptical.

What's so special about aio vs. epoll, and now signalfd/eventfd/timerfd
etc.?

Yeah, but that means the completion has to be delivered from process
context. That's not what aio does today, and it'd be a real performance
regression.

I don't know of a way around that myself.

No different from any other place the kernel allocates memory on behalf
of userspace... it needs a general solution, not a bunch of special case
solutions (though since the general solution is memcg you might argue
the cure is worse than the disease... :P)
