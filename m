The original code was gross regarding kobj handling there so I might
have overreacted.  Ah right, the refcnt doesn't belong there.  The
caller should already own both the master and slave devices (creator
of the former, exclusive opener of the latter) and that really should
be the extent of ownership that block layer tracks.
bk_[un]link_disk_holder() implements completely isolated refcnting
because dm somehow calls the function for the same pair multiple
times.

ISTR the problem w/ block layer was that because this adds a separate
layer of refcnting, it can't be tied to the usual rule of block device
access.  ie. we really shouldn't need bd_unlink_disk_holder() but the
linkage's lifetime should be bound to the exclusive open of the slave
device, which can't currently be done.

IIRC, there was only one case where this happens in dm, would you be
interested in tracking that down?  I'd be happy to lose the extra
refcnting code and tie it back to bdev exclusive open.

Being part of dm or dm should make this mostly irrelevant, no?

Thanks.
