I tried both of these on 4.6.0-rc7 without change to the symptoms (cache
device continuously read).  Then I tried also disabling
partial_stripes_expensive prior to registering the bcache device as per
your instructions here:

https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/2/1/636

and that seems to have improved things, but not fixed them.

The cache device is 120G, and dirty_data had got up to 55.3G, but has
now dropped down to 44.5G, but isn't going any further...

The cache device is being read at a steady ~270 MB/s, and the backing
device (dm-crypt) being written at the same rate, but the writes aren't
flowing down to the underlying devices (md RAID5, and SATA disks).  I'm
guessing that these writes are being refused/retried, and are maybe
failing due to their size (avgrq-sz showing > 4000 sectors on the
backing device)?  Disabling the partial stripes expensive maybe just
resulted in a few GB of small writes succeeding?
