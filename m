When I say cheap, I mean _cheap_:

split = bio_clone_bioset(bio, gfp_flags, bs);

bio_advance(bio, sectors << 9);
split->bi_iter.bi_size = sectors << 9;

And the clone doesn't copy the bvecs - split->bi_io_vec ==
bio->bi_io_vec.

The current situation is what causes you to repeatedly do the mapping
lookup, since you'll often get contiguous bios that don't need to be
split at the mapping level (because of other requirements of the
underlying devices or because implementing merge_bvec_fn correctly was
too hard).

Splitting only when required is going to _improve_ that.

There's also the 1000+ lines of deleted code to consider. In my
immutable bvec branch I've deleted over 400 lines of code, and that's
without actually trying to delete code. Getting rid of merge_bvec_fn
deletes another 800 lines of code on top of that.

CPU wise, there won't be any performance regressions. The only cause for
concern I can think of is where the upper layer could've made use of
partial completions - i.e. it submitted a 1 mb bio instead of a bunch of
128k bios, but it could've made use of that first 128k if it went to a
different device and completed sooner.

Only thing I know of that'd be affected by that though is readahead, and
I have a couple ideas for easily solving that if it actually becomes an
issue.
