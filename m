I'm not sure it's worth breaking out into a separate patch, but I
definitely should've mentioned it in the patch description.

It just didn't make sense to be using fs_bio_set if a bio_set wasn't
specified before - if a bio set wasn't specified we're still using
kmalloc for the bio_integrity_payload, so we're not protected from
memory allocation failures and it doesn't buy us anything.

All it does is introduce the possibility of deadlock, if we weren't
supposed to be using fs_bio_set for whatever reason.
