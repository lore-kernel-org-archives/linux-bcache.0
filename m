Yeah, I wonder how benefical that singly linked list is.  Eh well...

I don't know.  That at least represents what's going on and goto'ing
back and forth is hardly pretty.  Sometimes the code gets much uglier
/ unwieldy and we have to live with gotos.  Here, that doesn't seem to
be the case.

Hmmm... isn't it more like we "must" process only the bios which are
from this bio_set to have any kind of forward-progress guarantee?  The
above sounds like it's just something undesirable.

Thanks.
