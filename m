Ok. It's definitely a bit weird and unusual, and if I wasn't getting rid
of it in the next patch it would definitely merit a comment.

For stable... wtf would they be making that kind of change for, and
without reading the relevant code?

Eh, maybe I will stick in that comment and take it out in the next
patch.
