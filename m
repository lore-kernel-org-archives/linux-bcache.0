Because it's not obvious to me, either - I had to grep around through a
fair amount of code to figure out the semantics of BIO_SEG_VALID and I
doubt I have it 100%. I'm also pretty sure it's not used consistently in
the existing code...

If it means what I think it means, it should be obvious - nr_segs isn't
valid because the number of pages in the iovec changed (though we didn't
bother to copy it over anyways. So it's not necessary if nr_segs = 0
means nr_segs isn't valid, but bleh).

Anyways. yeah. BIO_SEG_VALID should be documented, and if it was I think
this code would be fine.

I will update the comment for the partial cloning thing:

/**
 * 	__bio_clone	-	clone a bio
 * 	@bio: destination bio
 * 	@bio_src: bio to clone
 *
 *	Clone a &bio. Caller will own the returned bio, but not
 *	the actual data it points to. Reference count of returned
 * 	bio will be one.
 *
 *	We don't clone the entire bvec, just the part from bi_idx to b_vcnt
 *	(i.e. what the bio currently points to, so the new bio is still
 *	equivalent to the old bio).
 */
void __bio_clone(struct bio *bio, struct bio *bio_src)
{
	memcpy(bio->bi_io_vec,
	       bio_iovec(bio_src),
	       bio_segments(bio_src) * sizeof(struct bio_vec));
