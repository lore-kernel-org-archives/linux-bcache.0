This is version 2 of this patch series - nothing major, documented a few things
and incorporated various review feedback. Please let me know if there's
anything I missed.

Couple related things in this patch series. This is mostly stuff I did for
bcache, polished/expanded up a bit:

 * Bio pool freeing. This moves freeing of bios allocated from bio pools into
   generic code.

 * Kill bi_destructor. That was Tejun's idea, but it turned out to be easier
   than I expected.

 * Improved bio splitting. This was originally part of bcache, but I pulled it
   out and replaced the existing bio splitting code with it.

 * Closures - this is from bcache. I didn't really need to use it for the next
   patch, but IMO it makes the code a bit more elegant.

 * Make generic_make_request() handle arbitrary size bios. I think this is
   going to enable a lot of cleanups in the future.

   The idea here isn't for generic_make_request() to be doing the splitting in
   practice long term, it's more just an intermediate stage. If this goes in, I
   think a lot of driver code - certainly a lot of virtual block drivers -
   could easily be made to handle arbitrary sized bios, and splitting will only
   happen when a bio is being redirected to two different devices or something
   like that. But this should enable a lot of cleanups without having to change
   every block driver first.
