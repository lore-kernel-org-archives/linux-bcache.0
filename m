I meant in the block layer.  For consecutive commands, queueing
doesn't really matter.

Those are transfer latencies - multiple orders of magnitude shorter
than IO latencies.  It would be surprising if they actually are
noticeable with any kind of disk bound workload.

All modern FSes are page granular, so the granularity would be
per-page.  Also, RAHEAD is treated differently in terms of
error-handling.  Do filesystems implement their own rahead
(independent from the common logic in vfs layer) on their own?

The feature is pointless for disks anyway.  Think about the scales of
latencies of different phases of command processing.  The difference
is multiple orders of magnitude.

Yeah, if that actually helps, sure.  From what I read, dm is already
(ab)using merge_bvec_fn() like that anyway.

Thanks.
