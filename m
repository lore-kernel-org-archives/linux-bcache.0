Wasn't an excuse, just an explanation.

You are entitled to your opinion, but it honestly didn't seem that
significant to me considering there was no code for splitting multi page
bio integrity stuff before.

You picked a particularly obscure codepath. I have personally tested all
of this code with both dm and md, and I spent quite a bit of time going
over the dm code in particular to verify as best I could that the
bio_clone() changes were safe.

I should've said more before how the patch series as a whole was tested,
but you hadn't asked either.

This patch series does touch a lot, and I'm certainly very new at
getting stuff into upstream. But I'm doing my best not to miss stuff,
and I've been asking you for advice and working on my workflow. And a
fair amount of the stuff in this patch series has been your ideas (it
was originally much more minimal).
