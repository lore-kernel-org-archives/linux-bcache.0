Incorporated various review feedback, and I reordered/reworked the patches to
make them more coherent.

This also has the latest version of the closure code, incorporating review
feedback from Joe and Tejun. I may rewrite the bio splitting stuff to not
depend on it so it can go in sooner (Tejun is not a fan of closures), but IMO
the patch is better for using them.

First 5 patches: Kill bi_destructor

Next 3 patches: Better bio splitting

Next 3 patches: Rework bio cloning to not clone entire bio vec

Tejun also pointed out that with the bio splitting improvements we ought to be
able to get rid of merge_bvec_fn, so I started on that. Those patches are
definitely a WIP, though.

For most of the md code, it looks like things will almost just work - they
already had bio_pair_split() calls to handle single page bios that crossed bvec
boundries, but bio_pair_split() now splits arbitrary bios so things should just work.

(I just thought of one problem - previously, in practice you'd never need to
split a bio more than once, but that's no longer true - so the
bio_pair_split() calls do need to be stuck in a loop, and the as is the
patches aren't correct.)

For raid5 though I couldn't find any splitting in the existing code - it looks
like it's depending on merge_bvec_fn to make sure bios never need to be split.
Adding bio splitting looks to be not quite trivial - Neil, any thoughts?

For dm, it was already splitting multi page bios when necessary, it looked like
its merge_bvec_fn was mostly for propagating device limits - which my
generic_make_request() patch handles. Any dm folks want to take a look?

There are only 4 merge_bvec_fns left in my kernel:

drivers/md/raid5.c - raid5_mergeable_bvec()
drivers/block/drbd/drbd_req.c - drbd_merge_bvec()
drivers/block/pktcdvd.c - pkt_merge_bvec()
drivers/block/rbd.c - rbd_merge_bvec()

I haven't looked at the last three, but if the maintainers want to help out a
bit it should be pretty easy to get rid of merge_bvec_fn entirely.
