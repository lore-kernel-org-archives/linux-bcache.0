And all those information should be in the patch description.  Imagine
this patch hitting some enterprise deployment, say four years after
now, and causing weird performance regression and someone succeeding
to bisect it down to this commit.  None of us would be remembering
much about this and could in fact be doing something completely
different.  Patches should at least try to record its visible
implications.

This type of information should be always attached to the patch not
only for future references but also to alert reviewers who aren't
necessarily following the whole series and its iterations.

Any chance we can do that with field name?

      "which may affect XXX in YYY cases but I think it's okay because ZZZ."

If you aren't that sure,

      "which may affect AAA but I don't think that's a big deal
       because BBB.  This definitely requires Martin's ack."

Thanks.
