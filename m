Are they not fully allocated bios and when you submit these to underlying
device, ideally we should not be sharing memory pool at different layers
of stack otherwise we will deadlock any way as stack depth increases. So
there should not be a dependency on original bio_set?

Or, am I missing something. May be an example will help.
