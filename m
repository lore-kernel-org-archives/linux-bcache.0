Buncha changes in this version.

I came up with a new, much better solution to the "bio allocation from
bio sets under generic_make_request()" problem. Previously, I was
working around this in all of my code that allocated bios; it'd mask out
GFP_WAIT if current->bio_list != NULL, then punt to workqueue if the
allocation failed - so as to avoid the deadlock from allocating multiple
bios from the same bio set.

This approach worked, but it required it to be explicitly handled in any
stacking driver that might split a bio an arbitrary number of times -
less than ideal.

My new patch inverts this - when we go to allocate a bio and we're
blocking another bio from being submitted, we punt the bio(s) that are
being blocked off to a workqueue to be submitted. This means we only
have to handle it in one place, in bio_alloc_bioset() - stack block
drivers no longer have to do anything special (I got to delete some code
from bcache, and dm wasn't handling this at all before).

Other big change - I consolidated bio allocation. Now bio_alloc(),
bio_kmalloc(), bio_clone(), and bio_clone_kmalloc() are all one line
wrappers.

Incorporated a bunch of review feedback, most of which I hopefully
remembered to note in the patch descriptions this time.
