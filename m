How are you seeing that/which log messages? I hadn't noticed that
myself (do they not get printed somehow?)

How's that created - what function am I looking for?

I'd been meaning to fix that, never got around to figuring out how those
stats are generated. Function/file you can point me to?

You mean the backing device isn't open, just the cache device?

That's intended behaviour, backing and cache devices have separate
lifetimes (and you can attach many backing devices to a single cache).

You just have to stop the cache set separately, via
/sys/fs/bcache/<uuid>/stop or /sys/block/<cache device>/bcache/set/stop
