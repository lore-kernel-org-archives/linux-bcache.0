To help narrow this down, I tested the following generic pre-compiled mainline kernels
on Ubuntu 15.10:

 * WORKS:  http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.3.6-wily/
 * DOES NOT WORK:  http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.4-rc1+cod1-wily/

I also tried the default & latest distribution-provided 4.2 kernel.  It worked.
This one also worked:

 * WORKS:  http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.2.8-wily/

So it seems to me that it is a regression from 4.3.6 kernel to any 4.4 kernel.  That
should help save time with bisection...
