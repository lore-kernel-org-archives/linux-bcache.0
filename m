Ah yeah, you're right. Meant to delete that comment anyways.

The number of calls to req_bio_endio() isn't changing...
blk_update_request() called it for partial completions before. It's just
where the bio itself is updated that's getting shuffled around.

Or did you mean that bio_advance() is getting called on every bio
instead of the custom advancing in blk_update_request() before? That is
different, yeah - it's now always looping over the iovec, not just for
partial completions.

Yeah, I will note that in the commit message, in case Jens sees a
performance regression from it :)

Any suggestions on how to trigger partial updates?
