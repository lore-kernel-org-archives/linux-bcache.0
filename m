Hadn't come across that in the kernel - the ~(~0 << foo) I got from K&R.
But I can switch.

Good idea, I'll do that.

I think to get 20 defined in a single place I'd have to have a separate
enum - something like:

enum closure_state_bits {
	CLOSURE_REMAINING_END	= 20,
	CLOSURE_BLOCKING_GUARD	= 20,
	CLOSURE_BLOCKING_BIT	= 21,
	etc.
};

and then the existing enum changed to use those. Verbose, but maybe the
best way to do it.

And gvim was already highlighting that for me :(

Definitely ugly, but the alternative would be
struct closure_WITH_WAITLIST;
struct closure_WITH_TIMER;

and this way at least the ugliness is confined to the internal
implementation.

Yeah.

Heh. Yeah, I felt dirty for writing that. But it prevents the typenames
and constants from getting out of sync.

Well, same with the last one it's mapping constants -> typenames and
preventing a mismatch. But I dunno, I might drop this one. Though it is
less painful to read than the last one.

Do you mean something like this?
seq_printf(f, "%s%s%s%s%s\n",
	   r & CLOSURE_RUNNING	? "R" : "",
	   r & CLOSURE_BLOCKING ? "B" : "");

Or do you have a better way of writing that in mind?
