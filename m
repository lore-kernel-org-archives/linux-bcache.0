I forgot about the bio_clone() one - you're right, that's also a
problem.

So, I had a patch queued up at one point as part of the immutable
biovecs series that changed bio_clone() and the dm bio cloning/splitting
stuff to use bio_segments() instead of bi_max_vecs. That is IMO a better
way of doing it anyways and as far as I could tell perfectly safe (it
was tested), but the patch ended up squashed for various reasons and I'm
not sure I want to recreate it just for this... though it would be the
cleanest fix.

bcache has a mempool for bios that are used for reading/writing
(potentially) entire buckets - but in the case where we're only writing
to part of a btree node and the bio didn't have to be split, that's when
we pass down our original huge bio.

I just had the horrible thought that an easy fix would probably be to
just reset bi_max_vecs to bi_vcnt in bcache before passing it down. If I
can't come up with any reasons that won't work, I may just do that.
