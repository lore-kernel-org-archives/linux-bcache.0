Aside from what Martin and Vivek already pointed out, it generally
looks okay to me but here are some thoughts.

I'm quite doubtful how much we're gaining by this complex set of slabs
and mempools approach compared to just using kmalloc + one mempool for
the largest size.  I can't think of anything to be gained in terms of
cacheline hotness.  In terms of memory usage too, we're proabably
introducing more fragmentation with all the different slabs.

Jens, what are you thoughts?  For forward progress guarantee, single
mempool per bioset serving the largest one is enough and we can
significantly simplify the whole bioset thing.

Thanks.
