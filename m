Understood. As, I usually am focused on PI and debugging, it may be
more fundamental to me than others.

Me either.

Actually, I'm thinking you are using it more as a completion than a
semaphore.

The problem is that all sleeping locks go through rt_mutex. The locks
are replaced with locks that incorporate PI.

I think this is what makes bcache unique in the kernel, and I don't
think there's open coded locks elsewhere.

Well, rwlocks and rwsems are not mutually exclusive ;-) The read side
has multiple accessors. A mutual exclusion also would be a single task
needing exclusive access to a resource. But as things are done in the
background, that is not the case. But we are arguing semantics here and
not helping with a solution.

OK, I'll see what I can do.
