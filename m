The problem is that bio_clone() is used on bios that were not allocated
or submitted by the cloning module.

If some code somewher submits a bio that points to 500 pages, but by the
time it gets to a driver it only points to 200 pages (say, because it
was split), that clone should succeed; it shouldn't fail simply because
it was trying to clone more than was necessary.

Bios have certain (poorly documented) semantics, and if this breaks
anything it's probably because that code was doing something crazy in
the first place.

In particular, if this change breaks anything then the new bio_split()
_will_ break things.

We need to be clear about our interfaces; in this case bi_idx and
bi_vcnt, in particular. Either this is a safe change, or it's not. If
no one knows... that's a bigger problem, and not just for this patch...

Fortunately this code actually has been tested quite a bit (and the bio
splitting code for even longer), and (somewhat to my surprise) I haven't
run into any bugs caused by it.
