Kent's threading was definitely messed up in this wave.  But threading
aside, I think all the posted patches are what he intended.

Looks like the "3 patch series" mentioned above map to:

[PATCH v2 00/26] Prep work for immutable bio vecs
[PATCH v4 00/24] Prep work for immutable bio vecs
[PATCH v4 1/2] block: Fix a buffer overrun in bio_integrity_split()

So you can key off of "v2 xx/26" vs "v4 xx/24" vs "v4 x/2"

But, yeah, not ideal..
