I totally agreed. There is a lot going on and design doc is going to 
help a lot while reviewing.

I had the same impression when I tried to read the code last. Too many
macros and it makes reading code really difficult.

Another thing is that keep variable names consistent. Last time I looked,
same name "c" was being used to represent cached_dev or cache_set or 
something else too. If we keep variable name same to represent same
data structure, it becomes easier to read the code. I was totally lost
and always had to go back to figure out what "c" is representing, what
"d" is representing etc.

Thanks
