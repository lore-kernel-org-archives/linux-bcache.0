Not all, I only did the easy one - you know how dm has all those crazy
abstraction layers? They've got multiple per bio allocations because of
that; the core dm code does one, and then some other code takes that
struct dm_io* and allocates its own state pointing to that (which then
points to the original bio...)

So front_pad should still work, but you need to have say dm_crypt pass
the amount of front pad it needs to the core dm code when it creates the
bio_set, and then dm crypt can use container_of(struct dm_io) and embed
like everything does that use the bio_set front pad.

*I'm probably misremembering all the names.
