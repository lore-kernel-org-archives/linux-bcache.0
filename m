It's not uninitialized, because it just called bio_init() - it was
entirely redundant before.

It's not strictly necessary, but immutable bio vecs require getting rid
of a lot of bi_idx usage, and everything that's left is either
unecessary or better/cleaner done some other way, so it's best to just
get rid of all of them - immutable bvecs changes the semantics of bi_idx
just enough that directly using it tends to be wrong.
