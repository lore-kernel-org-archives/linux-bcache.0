These patches were part of the block cleanups series I just sent out, but I
split them off. Nothing's changed with them lately, the last thing I added was
a bit of logic to the "punt to rescue" code to only punt bios that were
allocated from the current bio_set.

Kent Overstreet (2):
  block: Reorder struct bio_set
  block: Avoid deadlocks with bio allocation by stacking drivers
