Yeah, it's changing the semantics of bio_free(). I'll document that.

I don't think there's any memory leak issues with this patch... there
are various annoyances with the dm code, though.

Well, it would be possible to kill bi_destructor without introducing
bio_reset() - but that'd mean the kill bi_destructor patch would have to
muck around in the pktcdvd code. IMO introducing bio_reset() makes the
rest of the patch series much cleaner.
