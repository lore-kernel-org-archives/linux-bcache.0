I pulled your 'bcache-for-staging' code into a 'dm-devel-cache-bcache'
branch on my github:
https://github.com/snitm/linux

Purpose is to have a single kernel to compare dm-cache and bcache.  My
branch is against 3.8-rc2.  While importing your code I needed the
following change to get bcache to compile:
https://github.com/snitm/linux/commit/400b1257e93975864fd6c4b827537a0234551253

It now builds without issue but I haven't tested the resulting bcache to
know if I broke the sysfs interface due to s/cache/bcache/ on some local
variables, I don't think I did but I'll defer to you.  (BTW those crafty
sysfs macros you have were pretty opaque; not really seeing what they buy
in the grand scheme.  And #include "sysfs.c" is different than any code
I've seen in the kernel).
