Ok, this seems to be the code which will take care of freeing kmalloced
bio. I think putting little comment about the explicit assumption is not
a bad idea.

Somehow we need to integrate two patches so that we don't have memory leak
in bisection and reading code becomes easier.

Also then what's the need of bio_reset() in previous patch. That seems to
be independent from getting rid of pkt_bio_destructor(). I would think
that keep we can split the patch and keep bio_reset() logic in a separate
patch. In fact I am not even sure that for one driver we should introduce
bio_reset() in generic block layer. So to me we should get rid of bio_reset()
and let all the gory details remain in driver.

Thanks
Vivek
