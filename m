Yeah, that's probably apt :)

Haven't really thought about it (aside from deadlocks which are a
slightly different issue). AFAICT there shouldn't be much to worry
about, at least with the way I'm using closures today; scheduling is all
handled by the existing workqueue code and you have to explicitly say
which workqueue a function is going to run out of.

There are the wait lists I've implemented but that's mostly just for
when some thread/closure is waiting on an arbitrary event to become true
- analagous to wait_event(), in which case you want everything on the
wait list to to run at once which is all it implements.

If the closure wait lists ever did end up being used in a situation
where priorities or priority inversion was more of a concern it wouldn't
be a huge deal to swap out the implementation for something more
sophisticated, or just use the existing wait_queue_t.
