Never noticed that was introduced in its own patch until you pointed it
out.

That isn't a very good patch - it says it's clearing bi_end_io as a
precaution, but as a precaution to what?

As far as I can tell, it was never necessary. The bio is about to be
freed - there shouldn't be any other references on it (__bio_map() is
called on freshly allocated bios, and bio_get() is never called in dm.c)
Nothing else should've been looking at bi_end_io, certainly the
destructor didn't.

Now that there's no destructor, it makes even less sense to have it -
after that bio_put() that bio isn't being touched by dm code anymore.
