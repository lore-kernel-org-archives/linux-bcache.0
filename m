It is emphatically possible with dm, though you would probably need a
pathalogical configuration of your targets for it to be possible in
practice - at least with the targets currently commonly in use.

With most of the newer dm targets coming down the pipe I expect it
should be possible under real world configurations, with the caveat that
under that kind of memory pressure in practice many other things will
fall over first.
