Hello, Kent.

I do like the new implementation.  I think the function is broken
before and after tho.  Allocating from fs_bio_set from block layer is
never safe and nothing seems to prevent multiple allocators compete in
the bounce page mempool.  This will need a separate bioset and the
multiple mempool allocation would have to be put inside a mutex.

Also, how was this tested?

Thanks.
